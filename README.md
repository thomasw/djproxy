djproxy is a class-based generic view reverse HTTP proxy for Django.

## Why?

If your application depends on a proxy (to get around Same Origin Policy issues
in JavaScript, perhaps), djproxy can be used during development to provide that
functionality.

djproxy is not intended to be used in production, but should suffice for
development. Use your web server's proxy capabilities in the wild.

## Installation

```
pip install djproxy
```

djproxy requires requests >= 1.0.0 and django >= 1.4.0.

## Usage

Start by defining a new proxy:

```python
from djproxy.views import HttpProxy

class LocalProxy(HttpProxy):
    base_url = 'https://google.com/'
```

Add a url pattern that points at your proxy view. The `url` kwarg will be
urljoined with base_url:

```python
urlpatterns = patterns(
    '',
    url(r'^local_proxy/(?P<url>.*)$', LocalProxy.as_view(), name='proxy')
)
```

`/local_proxy/some/content` will now proxy `https://google.com/some/content/`.


### HttpProxy configuration:

* `base_url`: The proxy url is formed by
   `urlparse.urljoin(base_url, url_kwarg)`
* `ignored_downstream_headers`: A list of headers that shouldn't be forwarded
  to the browser from the proxied endpoint.
* `ignored_request_headers`: A list of headers that shouldn't be forwarded
  to the proxied endpoint from the browser.
* `pass_query_string`: A boolean indicating whether the query string should be
  sent to the proxied endpoint.
* `reverse_urls`: An iterable of location header replacements to be made on
  the constructed response (similar to Apache's `ProxyPassReverse` directive).

## Adjusting location headers (ProxyPassReverse)

Apache has a directive called `ProxyPassReverse` that makes replacements to
three location headers: `URI`, `Location`, and `Content-Location`. Without this
functionality, proxying an endpoint that returns a redirect with a `Location`
header of `http://foo.bar/go/cats/` would cause a downstream requestor to be
redirected away from the proxy. djproxy has a similar mechanism which is
exposed via the `reverse_urls` class variable. The following proxies are
equivalent:

Djproxy:

```python

class ReverseProxy(HttpProxy):
    base_url = 'https://google.com/'
    reverse_urls = [
        ('/google/', 'https://google.com/')
    ]

urlpatterns = patterns(
    '',
    url(r'^google/(?P<url>.*)$', ReverseProxy.as_view(), name='gproxy')

```

Apache:

```
<Proxy https://google.com/*>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /google/ https://google.com/
ProxyPassReverse /google/ https://google.com/
```

### HttpProxy dynamic configuration and route generation helper:

If you'd like to specify the configuration for a set of proxies, without
having to maintain specific classes and url routes, you can use
`djproxy.helpers.generate_routes` as follows:

In `urls.py`, pass `generate_routes` a `configuration` dict to configure a set
of proxies:

```python
from djproxy.urls import generate_routes

configuration = {
    'test_proxy': {
        'base_url': 'https://google.com/',
        'prefix': '/test_prefix/',
    },
    'service_name': {
        'base_url': 'http://service.com/',
        'prefix': '/service_prefix/'
    }
}

urlpatterns += generate_routes(configuration)
```

Using the snippet above will enable your Django app to proxy
`https://google.com/X` at `/test_prefix/X` and
`http://service.com/Y` at `/service_prefix/Y`.

These correspond to the following production Apache proxy configuration:
```
<Proxy https://google.com/*>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /test_prefix/ https://google.com/
ProxyPassReverse /test_prefix/ https://google.com/


<Proxy http://service.com/*>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /service_prefix/ http://service.com/
ProxyPassReverse /service_prefix/ http://service.com/
```

## Contributing

To run the tests, first install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you'd like to test this against a version of Django other than 1.5, wipe out
the 1.5 installation from `requirements.txt` by installing the desired version.

Run `nosetests` to execute the test suite.

To automatically run the test suite, pyflakes, and pep8 checks whenever python
files change use testtube by executing `stir` in the top level djproxy
directory.

To run a Django dev server that proxies itself, execute the following:

```
django-admin.py runserver --settings=tests.test_settings --pythonpath="./"
```

Similarly, to run a configure Django shell, execute the following:

```
django-admin.py shell --settings=tests.test_settings --pythonpath="./"
```

See `tests/test_settings.py` and `tests/test_urls.py` for configuration
information.
